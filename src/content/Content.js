    review: `Been lifting for a while now and still have trouble calculating what plates to use. This makes life at the gym so much easier, I never have to worry about miscalculating again. And it’s more than just calculating plates, there’s also neat info hidden around the app like learning about wilks and RPE. I wish I could give this more than 5 stars! And free, I would definitely pay for this app.`,

    reviewTitle: `Love this app`,
    review: `Out of the different calculators and bar loaders out there this app ranks the best. It’s super easy to use, i like the plateau tab because there’s solid info there. I like the estimated max and meet prep a lot(even though I don’t compete in powerlifting I like how I can gauge my sets and reps). I like the interface too.


    Overall it’s simple, straight to the point, and a great tool plus it’s a got a little sense of humor`,

    reviewTitle: `Amazing App!!!`,
    review: `This is one app I would definitely recommend to any competitive strength athlete. Easy to use and simple. I thought this was just a weight conversion app but it is much more than that. It takes everything into consideration including weight conversions, meet advice, rpe calculator, etc. All in all a great app and well designed.`,

    reviewTitle: `Id use and suggest to other powerlifter`,
    review: `During weightlifting sessions, primarily powerlifting, in powerlifting gyms with kilo plates, I’ve struggled to calculate the weight on a bar. Stepping into certain gyms, like mount Vernon, they have sheets up that say “4 reds and a silver = this amount of weight” so this app is pretty useful and fulfills it’s purpose; to quickly put the number in and for us powerlifter to do less thinking and more gripping and ripping.`,

    review: `I just started training with weights. It’s being a struggle understanding the change of weight but this app makes it easy peasy. Would totally recommend for someone just starting to train and needs a double check to their math.`,
